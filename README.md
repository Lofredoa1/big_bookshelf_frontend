# Big Bookshelf 
## Description

This is a full-stack application that allows users to connect with each other in order to exchange books locally. Users will be able to create personal accounts and customize their profiles where they can list their own books to exchange with the community. This application uses Google Books API to retrieve information about the book listed for exchange. Once a book is listed users will be able to add, view, update, and delete books. Users are able to message each other in order to coordinate details about a book exchange.
Front-end: React
Back-end: Python on Fast API
